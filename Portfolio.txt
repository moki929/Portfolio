What is SRS?

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed.
It lays out functional and non-functional requirements,
 and may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide.

Why SRS?

In order to fully understand oneâ€™s project,
 it is very important that they come up with a SRS listing out their requirements,
 how are they going to meet it and how will they complete the project.
It helps the team to save upon their time as they are able to comprehend how are going to go about the project.
Doing this also enables the team to find out about the limitations and risks early on.
